# Neural Collaborative Filtering in PyTorch

This repository shows you how to implement a Recommender System in PyTorch from scratch.

## Prepare the dataset

The file `u.data` is the one picked from MovieLens 100K archive. Run the following command to get the train and test split for the dataset.

`
python train_test_split.py
`

## Run the Item Popularity Model
The following command runs the model and prints the metrics 

` 
python itempop.py  
`

## Run the deep learning based Model
The following command runs the model and prints the metrics 

`
python MLP.py
`
